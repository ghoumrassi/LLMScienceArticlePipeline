Based on the above context and article plan, write {numquestions} Google search queries that will provide you with supplementary information to help in the writing of the article.

The queries should not answer questions that are already answered within the context. Instead they should provide interesting supplementary information.

Each new query should be presented on a new line and should be numbered (e.g. 1. how to build a house).
